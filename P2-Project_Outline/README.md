# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
My project will be a set list manager for musicians. I came up with this idea as I am a musician, and although
I am not usually the one who makes set lists, the band I am in knows well over 150 songs, and every gig is 
different, so it would be useful to have a library of all the songs with their lengths, titles, keys, categories 
(ie. wedding songs, songs we play every gig, etc.), and maybe a link to a recording or sheet music attached. 
Users would be able to create customized set lists with different song orders, or multiple setlists if a gig
 requires multiple sets with breaks in between. It would be useful for showing the total length of time for a 
 set and users would be able to reuse previous set lists and add new songs as they are learned. 

### Features
  User sign in - Users will be able to sign into their account, which will contain their own specific songs, setlists

  Add song - Users will be able to add a song to their song list, which will have title, length, and possibly key signature and a link to a video/audio recording of the song for reference

  Create setlist - users will be able to create a new setlist, and be able to add/remove any songs, and change the order of songs. Users will also be able to see the total length of the set.

  Multiple sets in one list -  Users will be able to create a setlist that incorporates set breaks (ie. 3 45 minute sets) and see how long each set is  
  Sharing? - might add a feature so that users can share setlists with other users, or via email.
### Technologies
Java  
Springboot  
Thymeleaf  
Javascript  
SQL  
Bootstrap/CSS  
HTML  
### What I'll Have to Learn
Javascript  
I'll need to learn how to change the order of songs in a setlist, as array lists in java are immutable. I'm sure I'm overthinking it.
